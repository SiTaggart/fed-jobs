#FED-JOBS
OK, so I've been trying to think of a little project to do to play with node.js and when I saw [DSGN JBS](http://www.dsgnjbs.com/), I thought it was a perfect opportunity. It is a brilliant idea, and I thought something similar for Front-end Development would be useful.

Of course the [making of Dsgn jbs](http://tomcavill.com/blog/building-dsgn-jbs/), shows it was brilliantly simple in it's conception but I wanted to make it harder for myself. So out came node, a web site and worker to collect new jobs, Heroku for hosting and a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/fed_jobs) later, and hey presto!

##Why completely open source
Well I'm hoping that in true Internet troll fashion, someone would take great offence to my terrible efforts at building a website for the first time in node, or wish to add more feeds for more awesome jobs and issue a pull request.

So if you are a small, petty minded Internet troll, don't be a dick bag about it and moan on the Internet, issue a Pull Request and maybe you'll add some value to the world and someone will learn something...
